# PCA - Exercise

### Context

Band spectra is the name given to groups of lines so closely spaced that each group appears to
be a band, e.g., nitrogen spectrum. Band spectra, or molecular spectra, are produced by
molecules radiating their rotational or vibrational energies, or both simultaneously.

Astronomical spectroscopy is the study of astronomy using the techniques of spectroscopy to
measure the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light and radio,
which radiates from stars and other celestial objects. A stellar spectrum can reveal many
properties of stars, such as their chemical composition, temperature, density, mass, distance,
luminosity, and relative motion using Doppler shift measurements. Spectroscopy is also used to
study the physical properties of many other types of celestial objects such
as planets, nebulae, galaxies, and active galactic nuclei.

In an astronomical observation, researchers used 17 different bands of the spectrum to analyze
4 celestial objects. Using the PCA - Principal component analysis find out which of the 4 celestial
objects does not behave like a star.
